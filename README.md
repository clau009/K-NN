# K-NN
This is my implementation of the K-NN machine learning classification algorithm.
* It is written in Matlab and uses the data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original) to classify the data into its two classes (Benign or Malignant)
* It uses ten-fold cross validation to split the data set into a training and test set
* It has the ability to change the number of K neighbors in the code so select how many neighbors to consider when classifying
* The program outputs Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity as measures of goodness
